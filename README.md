I quickly used a [generative adversarial network model](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) is leveraged to super enhance the first ever photograph of Einstein's black-hole, lead by PhD Katie Bouman.


Background
===
Einstein's general-relativity black hole viewed for the first time, lead by PhD scientist Katie Bouman. [Using machine learning]

Intriguingly Katie used machine learning to help reveal said black hole. Notably, Katie is not a trained astrophysicist, however her creativity has contributed, and the power of machine learning, has yet again produced extraordinary results.
