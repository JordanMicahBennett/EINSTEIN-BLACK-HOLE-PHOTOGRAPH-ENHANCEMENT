About
===
I quickly used a [generative adversarial artificial neural network model](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) to enhance or to generate super resolution version of the first ever photograph of Einstein's black-hole, lead by PhD Katie Bouman.

Background
===
Einstein's general-relativity black hole viewed for the first time, lead by PhD scientist Katie Bouman. [Using machine learning]

Intriguingly Katie used machine learning to help reveal said black hole. Notably, Katie is not a trained astrophysicist, however her creativity has contributed, and the power of machine learning, has yet again produced extraordinary results.

This is yet another scenario where machine learning has produced excellent results in a field, by a person, where said person isn't trained in said field.

Katie is not trained in astrophysics, yet through machine learning, and her creativity, excellent results have been produced in the field of astrophysics :]

Something to remember
==
An increase in resolution does not neccesitate that there's an increase in the accuracy of the information produced via original model!!
