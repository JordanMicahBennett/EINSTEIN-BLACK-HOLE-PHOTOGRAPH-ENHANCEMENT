About
===
I quickly used a [generative adversarial artificial neural network model](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) to enhance or to generate super resolution version of the first ever photograph of Einstein's black-hole, lead by PhD Katie Bouman.

Background
===
**Einstein's General-Relativity black hole** viewed for the first time, lead by PhD scientist **Katie Bouman. [Using machine learning]**

Intriguingly Katie used machine learning to help reveal said black hole. Notably, Katie is not a trained astrophysicist, however her creativity has contributed, and the power of machine learning, has yet again produced extraordinary results. I ponder, is her work Nobel Prize worthy?

Installation
==
1. Follow [the installation guide on the original repository](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution#installation). 

2. Download [the weights from original repository](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution/blob/master/weights/sample_weights/rdn-C6-D20-G64-G064-x2/ArtefactCancelling/rdn-C6-D20-G64-G064-x2_ArtefactCancelling_epoch219.hdf5), and place it in the [/weights/sample_weights/rdn-C6-D20-G64-G064-x2/](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/EINSTEIN-BLACK-HOLE-PHOTOGRAPH-ENHANCEMENT/tree/master/source-code/weights/sample_weights/rdn-C6-D20-G64-G064-x2/ArtefactCancelling) of this source code.



The power of machine learning 
==
This is yet another scenario where machine learning has produced excellent results in a field, by a person, where said person isn't trained in said field.

Katie is not trained in Astrophysics, yet through machine learning, and her creativity, excellent results have been produced in the field of Astrophysics :]


The power of Science overall
==
Katie's work also marks yet another way to further validate Einstein's General Relativity theory. This is another chance to see how magnificent Einstein really was, and also a chance to appreciate how tremendous and effective Science is as a tool.

Something to remember about this repository
==
An increase in resolution does not neccesitate that there's an increase in the accuracy of the information produced via original model!!
